### Instructions:

Each folder includes solution for the corresponding exercise. The pdf contains
all derivations and experiments. R file(s) include all functions which are
called in experiments. There is also a jupyter notebook (.ipynb) in each folder
from which the pdf are generated. If you are interested in, you can clone the
repo and run jupyter notebook locally (see

about how to install and run jupyter notebook on your computer), and rerun all
experiments.
